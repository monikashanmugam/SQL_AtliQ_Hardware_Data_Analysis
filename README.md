# SQL_AtliQ_Hardware_Data_Analysis

In this project, I analyzed sales data from AtliQ Hardware's customers, markets, dates, products, and transactions tables. By analyzing the data, I uncovered key patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can be used to inform business decisions.

Leveraging my skills in MySQL Workbench, I imported the Excel files into a SQL database on my local machine for further analysis.[Code](https://github.com/monikashanmugam/SQL_AtliQ_Hardware_Data_Analysis/blob/main/AtliQ-Hardware_Data_Analysis.sql)

I then transitioned to Power BI, where I built robust date tables using Power Query, ensuring accurate data analysis. Following the ETL methodology, I established data model relationships with Power Pivot and created calculated columns using DAX. Finally, I designed various compelling [visualizations](https://github.com/monikashanmugam/SQL_AtliQ_Hardware_Data_Analysis/blob/main/SalesInsights_pdf.pdf) in Power BI to effectively communicate the analyzed data.
