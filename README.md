# SQL_AtliQ_Hardware_Data_Analysis

This project utilized the customers, markets, dates, products, and transactions sales data tables from AtliQ Hardware. By analyzing sales data, I was able to discover patterns, trends, and insights that can be used to make business decisions.

I used MySQL Workbench to import the Excel files into a SQL database on my local machine to continue with the analysis. [Code](https://github.com/monikashanmugam/SQL_AtliQ_Hardware_Data_Analysis/blob/main/AtliQ-Hardware_Data_Analysis.sql)

And worked in PowerBi using data from SQL Database, using ETL methodology, created date tables using Power Qury, establishing data model relationship with Power Pivot, created a calculated columns using DAX.
